# Boskalis Business Data Engineering Assessment

Thanks you for your interest the data engineering landscape at Boskalis! We have prepared a technical assessment that mirrors real challenges we face in data engineering in the maritime and construction sector. The assessment consists of three parts that build upon each other:

1. First, you'll tackle a vessel data architecture challenge, designing a system that can handle data collection from our diverse fleet
2. Then, you'll optimize edge processing capabilities to ensure efficient data handling on vessels
3. Finally, you'll design a complete fleet management platform that brings it all together

Each part is presented as a realistic scenario through email exchanges between our team members. We want to see how you:
- Extract technical requirements from business communications
- Design scalable solutions that consider real-world constraints
- Balance technical ideals with practical limitations
- Consider costs and efficiency in your solutions

Please proceed through each part sequentially. You can ask clarifying questions at any point, and we encourage you to explain your reasoning behind key decisions.

Ready to begin? Start with Part 1, where you'll help design a data pipeline for our vessel fleet.
