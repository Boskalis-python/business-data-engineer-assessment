# Boskalis Business Data Engineering Assessment

Thank you for your interest in joining the Data Science & Engineering Team at Boskalis. We have prepared a technical assessment that focuses on real challenges we face in maritime data engineering. 
You will be presented with three distinct challenges, presented through email exchanges between our team members:

Architecture Challenge: Design a vessel data collection and processing architecture
Edge Computing Challenge: Optimize onboard data processing and transmission
Platform Challenge: Create a comprehensive fleet management platform

Please select one of these challenges to complete. While you only need to solve one part, we recommend reading through the complete email thread as it provides valuable context for each challenge. The emails present a continuing story that will help you understand the broader technical landscape and business requirements.
We want to evaluate your ability to:

- Extract technical requirements from business communications
- Designing a scalable solutions that considers real-world constraints
- Balance technical ideals with practical limitations
- Consider costs and efficiency in your solutions

We encourage you to explain your reasoning behind key decisions. Please specify which part you're choosing to tackle before providing your solution.

>[!TIP]
> - Please submit your solution as a markdown file, with the name `Part-X-Solution.md`, where `X` is the part number you're solving. You can include code snippets, diagrams, or any other relevant information to support your solution.
> - Please note that Boskalis is on Azure, so if you're using cloud services, we recommend using Azure services for your solution. Further Boskalis uses Databricks for data processing and Github for CI/CD.
